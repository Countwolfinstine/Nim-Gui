# Nim-Gui
NIM is a Player vs Computer Game.
Rules:
In each turn the player chooses the number of elements he wants to remove from any one of the given 3 sets.
The player must make a move, meaning he shouldn't take out 0 elements out of any set.
Also on one turn he can only choose one set to remove the items from.
The computer makes a similar move, that is it removes some number of elements from a single set, on its turn.
The player who removes the last number from the set, thereby making all the three sets empty is the winner.!!
GOOD LUCK!!!!! GG!!
