NIM - Player vs Computer Game.

Rules and how to play:

In each turn the player makes a move by choosing the number of items he wants to remove from any one of the given 3 sets.

The player is not allowed take out zero items out of any set.

On one turn, the player can only choose one set out of the three available sets to remove the items from.

The computer makes a similar move, that is it removes some number of elements from a single set, on its turn.

The player who removes the last number from the set, thereby making all the three sets empty is the winner.!!

GOOD LUCK!!!!! GG!!
